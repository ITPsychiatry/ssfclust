\title{Estimated U matrix with memberships.}
\usage{
estimate.U(X, V, F_, alpha, fun.distances, i_indices)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix \emph{X} of dimension (N, p) containing predictor variables.}

\item{V}{a prototypes matrix of dimension (c, p)}

\item{F_}{the supervision  binary matrix of the same dimension as \emph{U}.}

\item{alpha}{the scaling factor, a floating point > 0.}

\item{fun.distances}{A function of two arguments: matrices X and V of the same
number of columns.
It should return a matrix of (nrow(X) x nrow(V)) of distances
between each row of X and all rows of V.
In case of Euclidean distance, the result should not be squared!}
